				High school:
        </h1>
				<p>
					In high school I took two AP computer science courses and did very well in them. I came into the subject with a very decent understanding, and left with a more fleshed out understanding of the principles and fundamentals of computer science. I also took an art class where I developed my love and abilities for 3D modelling. I also took two years of German language class, and have a basic understanding of the language. I graduated from Northridge High School, in Middlebury Indiana

        <h1>College:</h1>
				<p>
					I was enrolled in Ivytech Community College. My cumulative GPA is 3.4. I'm not seeking out any specific degree, I'm just taking classes that I think would serve useful. I've taken Intro to Informatics, A+ Cert Prep Hardware/Software, Web Development, Intro to Entrepreneurship, and Entrepreneurial Marketing. I've taken a break from college though to work on game development, I would like to come back to it to take an application development course.
